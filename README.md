##### In this project, we performed Web browser UI automation testing on the United airlineâ€™s Website that includes: smoke test, sanity test, and regression tests using Selenium Java. Testing some of the main functionalities of the website. We Implemented the BDD framework with cucumber and TestNG, following the page object model.
